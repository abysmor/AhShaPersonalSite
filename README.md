# Angela Yu 2022 Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp - Project 001 - Personal Site
This is my 1st project for this bootcamp, a simple website built in pure HTML with no styling, APIs, or scripting. We covered basic formatting, linking, tables, and forms. The result was a 4 page site that is used to display ay rudimentary personal portfolio. All of the information contained inside it is accurate, including information on certain external links, but my personal contact information (phone and address) has been scrubbed for privacy, since this is a public repository. The contact form works, however simply, and the contact email is accurate. Please reach out via email with any questions.

This site has been deployed to the public using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

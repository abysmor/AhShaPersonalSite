    <p><strong>Current occupation: </strong><em>E-Discovery Analyst</em></p>
    <p>
      I am an eDiscovery professional aiming to transition my career into Agile
      project management. I love to learn, and love to see people succeed. I can
      identify workflow bottlenecks and areas for improvement, and my aim is to
      lead teams to be the best versions of themselves that they can be.

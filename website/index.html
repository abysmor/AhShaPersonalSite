    <p>
      I am an eDiscovery professional aiming to transition my career into Agile
      project management by learning to develop. I love to learn, and love to
      see people succeed. I can identify workflow bottlenecks and areas for
      improvement, and my aim is to lead teams to be the best versions of
      themselves that they can be.
